* Dart DevTools Changes

## 0.0.1
 * Enable simple Dart expressions in the console and watch panes. So far this
   only supports expressions of the form "object.thing.otherThing" and some
   variables are not visible (e.g. top-level library variables) We expect to
   extend this.
 * Turn custom formatters on by default
 * Turn on black boxing of the SDK by default
 * Includes a pending Chrome fix for one of the known breakpoint issues.
 * Make the theme dark by default, so it's more clearly distinguished from
   normal devtools.
 * Adds a warning when a breakpoint isn't set as expected with instructions for
   filing a bug.
 * Make the theme dark by default, so it's more clearly distinguished from
   normal devtools.
